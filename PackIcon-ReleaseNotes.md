# Pack Icon Release Notes

Because the Pack Icons are [automatically generated](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit/actions/workflows/icon_update.yml), they are omitted from considered from Semantic versioning of the library. This means that it is possible for the PackIconKind enum to contain a breaking change in a minor version release. It is also possible for icons to have their visual appearance changed from version to version. As a way of keeping track of these changes so their, these release notes are generated. When updating you can simple search these release notes to determine if there have been any changes to the icons in use by your application.
